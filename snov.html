         PLEASE NOTE: If you do not READ this, you will regret it. This site is best experienced with Netscape 4.0+, RealAudio 3.0, a VRML 2.0 compliant browser, and fonts set to a small sans serif, like Geneva 9 pt (Mac), Helvetica (SGI), and Aerial (PC). DO THIS through your browser's: 'Options' -&gt; 'General Preferences' -&gt; 'Fonts' menu. You should turn off link underlining as well. Do this in the: 'Options' -&gt; 'General Preferences' -&gt; 'Appearance' menu. FINALLY, be aware that many of the images within the project are ACTIVE LINKS in and out of spaces.
