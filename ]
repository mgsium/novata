        <h3>chapter 1: yachts</h3>
        <p>
            my father bought me my first yacht when i was three.
            it was my third birthday, in fact, and i was opening
            my presents when i saw it.
            it was a yachtmaster 2000 mk 1, and it had just come out
            the previous year. he unveiled it to me at our private
            dock. i walked out and examined it. taking the remote
            control that it had come with (i wasn't old enough to pilot
            it yet, and it was advanced enough to have a remote control
            - those of you with yachts will understand), i drove the yacht
            to the middle of our private bay. then i took the grenade launcher
            my father had bought me (i know what you're thinking: why on
            earth was a three year old child only receiving two presents on
            their birthday? i felt the same way; my father didn't really
            appreciate me, i suppose.) and i detonated that piece of garbage.
            'FATHER!' i shouted. 'THIS IS A 2000 MK 1! THIS CAME OUT 
            L A S T Y E A R!' my father tried to calm me down. the nerve!
            my rights were being infringed upon there. using my grenade launcher
            (thanks for not buying me a <i>real</i> weapon, father - two presents,
            my foot) i walked him to the car, where we drove to a boat show
            and i bought myself (with my father's money; i could have payed myself,
            but i wasn't the one who messed up here!) a yachtmaster 2001 mk 2.
            oh, the fun i had. childhood.

        <h3>chapter 2: queen</h3>
        <p>
            i got a lot of enjoyment out of my first yacht, but there comes a point in
            every child's life where they must move on. for me, that point was when
            i realized my 2001 mk 2 wasn't good enough. my father had learned his lesson
            about not buying me enough birthday gifts, luckily, so i had a new weapon
            on hand to force him to the car with. we went to a boat shoat. i knew i had to
            up my boat game here, so why just stop at one boat? i bought everything in the lot.
            yachts upon yachts upon yachts. i did have to detonate a good half of them,
            but that was ok - my father's attitude had improved somewhat since my
            third birthday and we were able to go to another boat show to make up for the losses.
            this was around the time i got into stocks. i invested, of course, in
            yachtmaster - i hoped to eventually buy enough shares to have control of
            the company, and get some nice yachts for myself. my father, being a
            top executive there, wasn't so keen on this idea, but a little persuasion
            goes a long way. (you've got to get some.)
